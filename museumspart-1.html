        <h2 id="no_7">No.07 - Acropolis Museum</h2>
        <p class="blogg"> After experiencing the war zone let's get some rest and  peace by looking at the amazing archaeological objects. At No.7 we have Acropolis Museum which is located in 	Dionysiou Areopagitou Street
            Athens, Greece. As you can expect from my earlier statement, this is an archaeological museum focused on the findings of the archaeological site of the Acropolis of Athens.<br>
            We had over more than <b> 4,250 </b> objects in this  museum. When we get to the most important part of this museum is most of the building including the floors are made up of glass. Just be careful while walking on these glass floors they make be broken inside your head but not in reality(just kidding). They are made up of the strongest material so don't worry about it and just enjoy the sculptures and archaeological objects all over the museum.
